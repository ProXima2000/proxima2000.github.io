                         <h3>üìå Disclaimer</h3>              
        
        <p>All content on this website is provided for information only. While I do my best to ensure accuracy and quality, the materials and services offered here do not replace professional advice in legal, medical, or educational fields.
        </p>
            
        <h4>Web Content Creation</h4>

            <p>All web content writing, editing, and creative support are based on 
                personal experience and industry-standard tools. While I strive to 
                provide high-quality, functional content and support, I do not guarantee 
                specific business or SEO outcomes. Clients are responsible for final review 
                and publication decisions.

            </p>

        <h4>Website Services</h4>

            <p>I offer support for small websites, including copywriting, basic editing, 
                translation, and content updates. I aim to make your site more user-friendly 
                and professional, whether you're just starting or need help managing what‚Äôs 
                already there. However, I don‚Äôt offer hosting, development, or technical 
                troubleshooting beyond basic admin tasks.

            </p>


        <h4>Medical Translations & Healthcare Interpreting</h4>

            <p>I hold a Level 3 Certificate in Community Interpreting (Healthcare), 
                and I offer non-certified translations for general 
                medical understanding. However, these services are not a substitute 
                for certified medical translations or licensed medical advice. I do 
                not accept liability for how translated content is used in clinical 
                or legal contexts.
            </p>
       
        <h4>Self-Publishing Guidance</h4>

            <p>My support with self-publishing on Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing 
                (KDP) is based on practical knowledge and previous project 
                experience. I am not affiliated with Amazon or its subsidiaries. 
                While I aim to help your project succeed, I cannot guarantee sales 
                or platform performance. Final publishing decisions rest with the 
                author.
            </p>
        
        
        <h4>External Links</h4>
        
            <p>Links to third-party platforms are provided for convenience. I am 
                not responsible for the content, services, or policies of these 
                external sites. Users should review the terms of each platform 
                before engaging.
