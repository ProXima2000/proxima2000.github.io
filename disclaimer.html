                         <h3>📌 Disclaimer</h3>              
        
        <p>All content on this website is provided for information only. While I do my best to ensure accuracy and quality, the materials and services offered here do not replace professional advice in legal, medical, or educational fields.
        </p>
            
        <h4>Web Content Creation</h4>

            <p>All web content writing, editing, and creative support are based on 
                personal experience and industry-standard tools. While I strive to 
                provide high-quality, functional content and support, I do not guarantee 
                specific business or SEO outcomes. Clients are responsible for final review 
                and publication decisions.

            </p>

        <h4>Website Services</h4>

            <p>I offer support for small websites, including copywriting, basic editing, 
                translation, and content updates. I aim to make your site more user-friendly 
                and professional, whether you're just starting or need help managing what’s 
                already there. However, I don’t offer hosting, development, or technical 
                troubleshooting beyond basic admin tasks.

            </p>


        <h4>Medical Translations & Healthcare Interpreting</h4>

            <p>I hold a Level 3 Certificate in Community Interpreting (Healthcare), 
                and I offer non-certified translations for general 
                medical understanding. However, these services are not a substitute 
                for certified medical translations or licensed medical advice. I do 
                not accept liability for how translated content is used in clinical 
                or legal contexts.
            </p>
       
        <h4>Self-Publishing Guidance</h4>

            <p>My support with self-publishing on Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing 
                (KDP) is based on practical knowledge and previous project 
                experience. I am not affiliated with Amazon or its subsidiaries. 
                While I aim to help your project succeed, I cannot guarantee sales 
                or platform performance. Final publishing decisions rest with the 
                author.
            </p>
        
        
        <h4>External Links</h4>
        
            <p>Links to third-party platforms are provided for convenience. I am 
                not responsible for the content, services, or policies of these 
                external sites. Users should review the terms of each platform 
                before engaging.
            </p>
               

        <h3>🔐 Privacy Policy</h3>
        
            <p>I respect your privacy and take it seriously. If you contact me 
                through this site (for example, by filling out a form or sending a 
                message), I’ll only use your information to respond to your inquiry. 
                I don’t collect any personal data unless you choose to share it with 
                me.
            </p>   

            <p>I never sell, share, or pass your details to third parties for marketing. 
                If you book services through platforms like Fiverr or Tutor, please refer 
                to their privacy policies, as your data is handled separately there.
            </p>

            <p>You have the right to request access to any personal data I may hold about 
                you — and to ask for it to be corrected or deleted at any time.
